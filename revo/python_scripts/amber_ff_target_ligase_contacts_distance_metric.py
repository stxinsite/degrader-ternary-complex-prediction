4. Define functions for preparing the system. You could also build

5. The "main" function. This is needed because of the use of

  e. Initialize the reporters. This includes the WepyHDF5 reporter                                                                                              
  which produces an HDF5 file with all the data from the run. Here you                                                                                          
  can customize a lot of features related to saving data efficiently

  to only be saved at certain intervals (i.e. sparse fields).                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                
  f. Initialize the work mapper by specifying the number of workers and                                                                                         
    the type of worker to be used.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                
  g. Create the walkers with the initial states for each with uniform

  h. Initialize the simulation manager with all the components.
